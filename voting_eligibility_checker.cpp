 Voting Eligibility Checker (C++)

A simple and interactive C++ program that checks **voting eligibility** in the **United States** based on three key factors:

* Age
* U.S. Citizenship
* Voter Registration Status

Description

This program prompts the user to enter their age, whether they are a U.S.-born citizen, and whether they are registered to vote. It then uses a set of conditional statements to determine if the person is eligible to vote and displays a message accordingly.

It helps users understand why they are or aren‚Äôt eligible to vote and encourages proper registration and participation.
